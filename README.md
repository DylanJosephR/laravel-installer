=======

A Laravel 3 and 4 Install Script for Linux

This Linux Bash Script will install Laravel and, if needed, all dependencies (webserver, php5 and extensions like mcrypt, phpunit and more)

### Installation and Usage

There is no need to clone this git repository, you just have to download the script:
```
wget --no-check-certificate -O -  \
  https://raw.github.com/antonioribeiro/laravel-installer/master/laravel.sh \
  > /tmp/laravel.sh

```

And run the following:
```
bash before-install.sh
time bash /tmp/laravel.sh
```

Other examples of usage
```
bash laravel.sh
bash laravel.sh /var/www/blog blog YES
bash laravel.sh /home/taylor/www blog NO
bash laravel.sh /var/www/blog myBlog YES
```

### Laravel Versions

This script will install one of those Laravel versions:

- Laravel 3.0 (currently 3.2.14)
- Laravel 4.0
- Laravel 4.1

### Supported Operating Systems

* Debian (tested on 6 and 7)
* Ubuntu (Desktop and Server)
* Redhat
* Fedora (tested on 17 and 18)
* CentOS (tested on 6.3)

### Requirements

You just need a Linux box with nothing else installed and script will install everything for you or you can use a working PHP development environment and it will install only Laravel and what is missing for it to work.

Web Server: a the moment it only knows how to install and configure apache2, if you need any other webserver (nginx, lighthttpd...), you'll need to do the virtual host creation part manually.

Your user need to have writing permissions to the installation directory, this script will not use sudo to create you directories and download files, but will use it to install needed software.

If this script needs to install software (apache, php5, you will need sudo or root permissions.

### Screencasts

Only 20 seconds to boot an application in Laravel 4

![Demo Screencast](http://www.screenr.com/bTIH)


### Installed software

In the process of installing the entire environment or just Laravel, this script will also try to install, if needed, the following applications in your system:

* Apache2
* PHP 5
* Composer (http://getcomposer.org/)
* git 
* curl
* wget
* unzip
* php5-mcrypt
* PHPUnit (composer install)
* less (http://lesscss.org/ and https://github.com/cloudhead/less.js) - optional
* Node.js and npm - optional
* Bower - optional

### Commands

This script will create the following commands in your system:

#### Composer
This is an executable version of composer.phar 

#### artisan 
You can call this artisan from any place in your system and has some options:

* Running it inside a Laravel directory (or subdirectory) it will act as "php artisan", so you don't need to use php anymore for artisan:
```
taylor@l4server:/var/www/blog> artisan
```

* Running from outside a Laravel directory it will fire laravel script to let you create a new Laravel service environment:
```
taylor@l4server:/> artisan
```

* Runnning it from any place using the argument "new" it will fire laravel installer script as well
```
taylor@l4server:/> artisan new
```

* Runnning it from any place using the argument "destroy" it will help you remove a site created with it:
```
taylor@l4server:/> artisan destroy
```
```
taylor@l4server:/> artisan destroy blog
```
```
taylor@l4server:/> artisan destroy blog -y
```

* Running "artisan update" from inside a Laravel directory (or subdirectory) it will try to "composer update" and "composer dump-autoload --optimize" site and phpunit:
```
taylor@l4server:/var/www/blog> artisan update
```
